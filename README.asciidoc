# a2dp-connect2

This is a simple widget (not an app) to connect/disconnect from A2DP Bluetooth sinks.  That is all it does.

.To use it:
 . Install from Play Store
 . Pair your Bluetooth devices using Android settings
 . Turn Bluetooth ON
 . Place an instance of this widget on your home screen (launcher dependent on how you do this)
 . Click it to connect a device, again to disconnect.

The widget will connect if the device is currently not connected, and disconnect if the device is currently connected.
